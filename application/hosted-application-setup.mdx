## Authentication Overview

[Client ID](#authentication-overview) - Remains accessible in your application settings and is also required for API authentication.

[API Key](#authentication-overview) - It is required for API authentication, displayed **only once** during creation. **Copy and store it securely**

[JWT Token](#authentication-overview) - `API Key` and `Client ID` are [exchanged](api-reference/authorization/generate-token) for a short-lived `JWT Token`, that will be used for the API call to generate hosted links

[OTP Authorization](#authentication-overview) - Depending on the actions, users may also be required to provide OTP code via their **Two-Factor Authentication** (2FA) method
