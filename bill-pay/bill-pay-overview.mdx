ClickPesa BillPay is a payment solution that enables you to receive instant payments both online and offline via multiple channels,
including mobile money, SIM banking, and Wakala.

Each merchant is assigned a unique 4-digit **ClickPesa BillPay-Namba**, which is combined with a
specific **order reference** to generate a **BillPay Control Number**.
Customers use this reference to make payments across supported channels, and you can track transactions through the [ClickPesa Dashboard](#), [Payment APIs](/api-reference/collection/querying-for-payments/querying-for-payments) and [Webhooks](/home/webhooks).
SMS and Email confirmations are also sent to both merchant and customer.
