- Seamless Integration -  Keeping you on your website or application when making payouts creates a seamless experience that aligns with your security concerns.
- Customizable Payout Experience - Customise parts of the payout experience to match your branding.

## How It Works

1. [Create Embedded Application](/application/embedded-application-setup) - You will need to create a ClickPesa Integration application to obtain **Client ID** and configure integration settings.

2. **Add ClickPesa Payout Widget on Your Platform**

   - [React Application Integration](/docs/embedded/react-integration): Embed ClickPesa's Payout component in your React application.
   - [HTML/JavaScript Integration](/docs/embedded/html-js-integration): Use ClickPesa's Payout script to integrate the payout widget in a plain HTML/JavaScript setup.
