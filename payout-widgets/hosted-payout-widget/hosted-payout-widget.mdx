## How It Works

1. [Create a Hosted Application](/application/embedded-application-setup) - Create an application and generate **Client ID** and **API Keys** for Hosted Payouts.

2. [Generate Authorization Token](/api-reference/authorization/generate-token) - Use **API Keys** to generate an Authorization Token.

3. **Generate Hosted Payout Link** - [Payout Link API](/payout-widgets/hosted-payout-widget/payout-link-api) - Use API to generate a hosted checkout link.

4. **Use the Payout Link** - Add the generated payout link into your payout flow to seamlessly initiate payouts to Mobile Money and Banks.
