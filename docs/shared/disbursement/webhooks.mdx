## Setting Up Webhooks

### 1. Access Webhooks Settings

- Log in to your merchant dashboard.
- Navigate to **Settings** -> **Developers**.
- Locate the **Webhooks Settings** section.

### 2. Add a Webhook URL

- Add URLs that will trigger `PAYOUT INITIATED`, `PAYOUT REVERSED` and `PAYOUT REFUNDED` events.

### 3. Webhook Calls

- The system sends HTTP POST requests to the provided URL upon an event.
- Your system must respond with a **2xx HTTP status code** to acknowledge receipt.
