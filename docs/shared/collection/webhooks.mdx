## Setting Up Webhooks

### 1. Access Webhooks Settings

- Log in to your merchant dashboard.
- Navigate to **Settings** -> **Developers**.
- Locate the **Webhooks Settings** section.

### 2. Add a Webhook URL

- Add URLs that will trigger `PAYMENT RECEIVED` and `PAYMENT FAILED` events.

### 3. Webhook Calls

- The system sends HTTP POST requests to the provided URL upon an event.
- Your system must respond with a **2xx HTTP status code** to acknowledge receipt.

> Note: This status code only indicates receipt, not successful processing. Extra data in the response is ignored.

## PAYMENT RECEIVED

When a payment is successfully completed, the `PAYMENT RECEIVED` event is triggered. This event provides you with key information about the payment, including identifiers, amounts, and customer details.

- `Description`: This event is triggered whenever a customer makes a successful payment. The webhook will send details of the transaction, including the amount, payer information, and transaction status.

- `Use Case`: Automate confirmation processes, update records, or trigger further actions in your system upon receiving a payment.

- Example Payload

```json
{
  "event": "PAYMENT RECEIVED",
  "data": {
    "paymentId": "PAY123456",
    "orderReference": "ORD987654",

    "updatedAt": "2024-04-10T18:22:56.153Z"
  }
}
```

## PAYMENT FAILED

- `Description`: This event is triggered when a payment attempt fails. The webhook will include information about the failure reason, the attempted transaction, and any relevant error codes.

- `Use Case`: Notify customers of payment issues, log failed transactions, or prompt retries.

- Sample payload

```json
{
  "eventType": "PAYMENT FAILED",
  "data": {
    "id": "0969231256LCP2C95",

> **Note:** These webhook events are applicable for all payments initiated from any platform associated with ClickPesa â€” including the Merchant Dashboard, Hosted Integration, API, Embedded, and more. For example, the `PAYMENT RECEIVED` event is triggered by payments from all supported platforms.
