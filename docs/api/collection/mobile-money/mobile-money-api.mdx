## Prerequisites

- **API Keys**: Ensure you have generated your API keys (client ID and API key) as outlined in the [Integration Setup](/application/api-application-setup) guide.

## Step 1: Generate Authorization Token

To authenticate your API requests, you need to generate an authorization token using your API keys.

## Step 2: Preview Push Request

This endpoint checks if the specified **amount** and **order reference** are valid.
It returns all available **payment methods** and their availability for processing the actual payment.

This step is useful for validating the transaction before initiating the final request. If there are any issues, the response will contain relevant errors—these are meant for internal handling and **should not be shown to customers**.

## Step 3: Initiate Push Request

This endpoint triggers a **USSD push** to the customer's mobile device.
The user will receive a prompt on their phone, requiring them to enter their PIN/password to complete the transaction.
