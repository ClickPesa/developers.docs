# API Integration â€“ Getting Started

The API Integration method gives you complete control over your integration with ClickPesa by interacting directly with our APIs. This method is ideal for businesses that require a fully customized payment solution with granular control over transactions.

## Why Use API Integration?

- **Full Customization:**
  Tailor your integration to meet your exact requirements without relying on pre-built components.
- **Direct API Access:**
  Communicate directly with ClickPesaâ€™s APIs to process payments, manage payouts, and query transactions.
- **Enhanced Control:**
  Implement advanced features and manage transactions programmatically.
- **Scalable and Secure:**
  Build a robust, scalable payment system backed by ClickPesaâ€™s secure infrastructure.

## Prerequisites
