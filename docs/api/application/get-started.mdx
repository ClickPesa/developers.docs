# API Integration – Getting Started

The API Integration method gives you complete control over your integration with ClickPesa by interacting directly with our APIs. This method is ideal for businesses that require a fully customized payment solution with granular control over transactions.

## Why Use API Integration?

- **Full Customization:**
  Tailor your integration to meet your exact requirements without relying on pre-built components.
- **Direct API Access:**
  Communicate directly with ClickPesa’s APIs to process payments, manage payouts, and query transactions.
- **Enhanced Control:**
  Implement advanced features and manage transactions programmatically.
- **Scalable and Secure:**
  Build a robust, scalable payment system backed by ClickPesa’s secure infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the following:

- **Registered an Application:**
  Create an application on our platform with the **API Integration** type.
- **API Keys:**
  Generate your API keys (Client ID and API Key) from your application settings.
- **Authentication Token:**
  Use your API keys to obtain an authentication token, which is required for authorizing API requests.

## How It Works
