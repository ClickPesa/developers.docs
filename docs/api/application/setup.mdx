## Step 4: Configure Application Details

When creating the application, fill in the following details:

- **Application Name**: Choose a name to identify your app.
- **Integration Type**: Select **API**.
- **Features**: Choose the features needed (e.g., Collection API, Payout API).

## Step 5: Manage API Keys

For applications using **API** integration types, API keys are crucial for authentication and performing actions such as querying transactions. Hereâ€™s how you manage API keys for your applications:

In your application settings, click **Manage API Keys**. This opens a drawer displaying a list of existing API keys for the application. The list includes:

- **Name:** The name assigned to the API key.
- **Last Activity:** The date of the most recent use of the API key.
- **Revoke Button:** An option to revoke the API key.

### Adding a New API Key

To add a new API key:

1. Click the **Add API Key** button.
2. When prompted, enter the following details:
   - **Name:** A name for the new API key.
   - **Expiry Date:** Select an expiry date for the API key.
3. After submitting, a modal will appear displaying:
   - The **clientID** and the newly generated **API key**.
   - The **expiry date**.

### Viewing and Storing API Keys

- The **api-key** is shown **only once** in the modal. **Copy and store it securely**â€”you'll need it for authentication and other actions.
- The **client-id** is always visible in the application settings and can be used along with the API key for tasks such as authentication and querying transactions.
