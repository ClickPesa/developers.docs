## Payment Status in the ClickPesa Dashboard
- You can view the payment status in the [ClickPesa Dashboard]('/clickpesa-dashboard') under the [Transactions](/dashboard/transactions) section.
- The payment statuses are updated in real-time as the payment progresses through different stages.

## Payment Status In Your Application
There are two ways to receive payment statuses in your application:

1. [Webhooks](/home/webhooks) - ClickPesa sends real-time updates to your server when a payment status changes. You can use webhooks to receive these updates.
2. **Querying** - Alternatively, you can make API calls periodically to [Payment API](/payment-api/payment-api-overview) query payment endpoint.

- Additionally, the final payment notificationSuccessfully made payment  is sent to the customer via their registered email or mobile phone number.
