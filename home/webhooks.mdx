Webhooks are HTTP `POST` callbacks that deliver notification messages for events.
ClickPesa uses webhooks to inform your systems when transactional events occur. This way, your servers are always up to date with transaction information.


<Note>Webhook events are published from actions in any of the ClickPesa products, including the ClickPesa Dashboard, Hosted Integrations, Embedded Solutions and APIs .</Note>
