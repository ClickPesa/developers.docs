## **Ask yourself**

- Do I need a ready-to-use payment tool, or do I require a custom integration?
- Do I have a website or an app, or do I need a simple link-based solution?
- Am I handling business payments, consumer payments, or both?

## **Use Cases**

**ClickPesa Checkout**

Any businesses selling products or services online that need to accept multiple payment methods through a single integration. A Tanzanian online fashion store requires a payment solution that supports Mobile Money, Cards, and Bank Transfers to serve a diverse customer base.

**ClickPesa Dashboard**

A central platform for tracking payments, managing bulk payouts, and generating invoices. A logistics company with multiple drivers can use it to monitor revenue, process payouts, and invoice clients.

<Info>The Dashboard is required for Account Setup and API key retrieval, for all integration type.</Info>

**Payment Pages**

For individuals and businesses without a website who need a simple and quick way to collect payments. A fitness coach selling training programs can create a payment page and share the link via WhatsApp for clients to complete their payments online.

**E-Invoice**

For businesses that issue invoices and require a structured payment collection process. A law firm regularly invoices clients for legal services and needs a way to send professional invoices that allow customers to pay securely online.
