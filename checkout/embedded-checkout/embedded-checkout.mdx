- Seamless Integration -  Keeping the customer on your website when checking out makes the experience seamless and allays security concerns.
- Customizable Checkout Experience - Customise parts of the payment experience to match your branding.

## How It Works

1. [Create Embedded Application](/application/embedded-application-setup) - You will need to create a ClickPesa Integration application to obtain **Client ID** and configure integration settings.


2. **Add ClickPesa Checkout on Your Platform**

   - [React Application Integration](/docs/embedded/react-integration): Embed ClickPesa's Checkout component in your React application.
   - [HTML/JavaScript Integration](/docs/embedded/html-js-integration): Use ClickPesa's Checkout script to integrate the checkout in a plain HTML/JavaScript setup.
