## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication using a `Bearer token`. Before making requests, you must obtain an access token.

### Obtaining a Token

To generate a Bearer token, use the [generate token](../api-reference/Authorization/generate-token) endpoint.

### Using the Token

Once you have a token, include it in the `Authorization` header for all authenticated requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
